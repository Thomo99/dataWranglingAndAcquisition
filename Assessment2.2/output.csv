arnold-j,"On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking ""non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,"" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets."

While the SEC generally requires that key executives report these transactions, experts say the rules are largely ignored.

""We do not believe the SEC matter has any basis whatsoever. And the documentation will show in no uncertain terms that Mr. Budhraja was never involved in insider trading."""
dasovich-j,"Kaufman said Budhraja's stock purchases do not constitute insider trading because the transactions occurred before state officials first talked with the consultant about a job Jan. 25, so he could not have decided to buy because of confidential information."
