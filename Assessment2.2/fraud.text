These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action.

./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about 40 large companies for accounting fraud, and many of these inquiries focus on the companies' top executives, the SEC's chief law-enforcement official said. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:"A lot of the fraud seems to be resulting from executives feeling pressure to beat stock analysts' expectations," SEC Enforcement Director Richard H. Walker said in an interview Friday.
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:The SEC is conducting about 260 accounting fraud investigations, about 2 1/2 times the number of such cases that were filed last year, Walker said. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who left the agency in February, made financial fraud the agency's chief enforcement priority during the last couple of years of his tenure. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:Walker had said Levitt's departure wouldn't affect the agency's investigative priorities. Last month, the SEC filed fraud charges against Arthur Andersen, which agreed to pay $7 million to settle allegations it issued false audit reports about Waste Management Inc. for five years. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:In addition to the $7-million fine, Arthur Andersen agreed to what the SEC said was the first anti-fraud injunction in more than 20 years against an accounting giant. It also agreed to be censured. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items//19.:Accounting firm Andersen has agreed to pay $110 million to Sunbeam Corp. shareholders to settle a fraud lawsuit concerning its work for the struggling appliance maker. The settlement is the second-largest ever paid by an accounting firm in a securities lawsuit, said Robert Kornreich, an attorney for shareholders. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Sunbeam, maker of Sunbeam, Oster and other appliances, has battled shareholder lawsuits and has been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices. Sunbeam's stock became virtually worthless after the company was forced to restate its profit and losses for the six quarters before former Chairman Al Dunlap was fired in 1998. Andersen, formerly called Arthur Andersen, denied any wrongdoing but said it decided to settle for business reasons. The settlement covers at least 10,000 shareholders who bought options in 1997 and 1998.

The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today. The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.  There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties "on notice" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001. Our attorneys are reviewing this, but on first blush, our California attorney says the CPUC would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of DA.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/31.:The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal ways of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This week, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems "had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balance sheet".

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.

Andersen, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC's fraud allegations, paid $75 million in 1998 to settle its portion of a shareholder lawsuit over the Houston-based garbage hauler. Also this year, without admitting wrongdoing, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:By bringing the prosecutors together, while simultaneously adding the manpower from the department's fraud section, legal experts said, the government is raising the probability of indictments. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry. For example, in the 1990's, when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section, some critics contended -- to the vehement denials of Justice officials -- that Washington was trying to protect Archer, the politically influential grain company. Enron, whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, has exercised similar political influence in the past. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron's heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron's financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:The Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog agency in Washington, examined the political contributions of 29 top Enron executives and directors named in a shareholder lawsuit filed against the company last month. Twenty-four of the 29 made contributions from 1999 to 2001 -- totaling nearly $800,000 -- to George W. Bush, members of Congress, the two national political parties (with the bulk of the contributions going to the Republicans) and a variety of officials who are now responsible for investigating possible securities fraud by Enron.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//146.:Scheer's commentary, although timely and proper, was at the same time provocative and accusatory. Not what the country needs at this moment. However, the president could take a cue from his foreign policy and freeze the assets of Enron executives who profited from company bonuses and the sale of Enron stock. This action would no doubt find favor with Enron shareholders who lost their retirement investments through mismanagement and possible fraud by company executives.

"I would think it highly unlikely at this stage in the game that Fastow would go in and testify before a committee and say things that could be used against him.

./maildir/sanders-r/misc//70.:	Today Stacy and I spoke with Mike Farrell, Adkins' attorney.  It was brief and to the point.  I told him that his August 8, 2001 demand letter makes no reference to a verbal deal for a fixed price done on March 6 that was confirmed in writing by fax to his client on March 8.  Farrell told me that Adkins had not advised him of any such deal.  Farrell, who is quick on his feet, asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect.   Once he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counter-party signature, Farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue, given that the deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year.
./maildir/sanders-r/misc//70.:	However, there are at least two counter-arguments.  First, the underlying base contract that was assigned to ENA from CES was signed by Adkins; in fact, to that base contract is attached a confirm for one-year floating index price deal with an evergreen clause, which I think is the deal Adkins is trying to enforce--and that confirm is signed only by CES.  Second, since (as John confirmed for me a moment ago) we hedged the fixed price deal, we may have good promissory estoppel arguments sufficient to trump a statute of frauds argument.

Increased financial disclosure is the critical issue for the industry, not mark-to-market itself. Accrual accounting for energy trading contracts, which has been replaced by mark-to-market in most circumstances, provides more opportunities for fraud, manipulation and deception. <BR>

./maildir/white-s/inbox//386.:Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place  a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never heard of doing that until  advised by a bank that called to tell me and application for credit was made  over the Internet in my name. The alert means any company that checks your  credit knows your information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone  to authorize new credit. By the time I was advised to do this, almost 2 weeks  after the theft, all the damage had been done. There are records of all the  credit checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about  before placing the alert.
