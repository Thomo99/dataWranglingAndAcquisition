./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//518.:Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles.

./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//468.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//468.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.

./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//661.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//517.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items//445.:Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.

Those buyers, he said, are hoping not to be hit by the "double swords" hanging over the Houston energy trader -- a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with an off-balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit-rating downgrade by Moody's, which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors.

./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1592.:HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it has provided additional information about off-balance sheet and other transactions that led to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a shattering of the energy trader's credibility. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1523.:No longer, of course. Enron stunned investors on Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss, and since then it has revealed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships, some involving the company's own executives. Enron says its board has formed an independent committee to review the transactions. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1523.:To be sure, the adequacy of a company's related-party disclosures can be determined only when all the information about the transactions is out in the open. For its part, Enron -- which is hardly the only large energy company with complex partnership dealings -- maintains its off-balance-sheet transactions were legal and properly disclosed. "They comply with reporting requirements," says Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne, adding that Andersen was aware of the transactions and reviewed them. "To the extent that an investor doesn't understand them, they are able to ask questions." And in the end, she notes, investors who didn't understand the transactions didn't have to buy Enron stock. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1523.:"I don't see how that possibly hedges any of Enron's risks or assets," Mr. Carmichael says. Indeed, the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that Enron's actual purpose was to use its off-balance-sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement. Asked whether that was Enron's purpose, Ms. Denne declines to comment. She says Enron stands by its earlier statement that Enron was trying to hedge certain investments. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//805.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations.

./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1496.:Moody's, a rating agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above "junk" level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet partnerships.

The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron.

./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1653.:"I'm not persuaded that you'll find anything illegal," Watson said Tuesday, commenting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into Enron's off-balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships.
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1653.:Concerns about Enron's dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships like JEDI II drove the company's stock price down 80% in the three weeks before the merger was announced. Its credit ratings were also downgraded to one level above junk. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1653.:Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1653.:Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off-balance sheet deals now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1581.:Hidden from investors by off-balance sheet transactions are billions of dollars of derivative contracts that Enron has entered into with banks and investment firms as well as other energy companies. Some are hedging transactions while others are contracts to sell a commodity at a specific price at some time in the future. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1581.:Enron is under attack over investor unease about its off-balance sheet transactions that led to a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1581.:Off-balance sheet vehicles affiliated to Enron have $8-$9bn in debt. Enron itself is carrying $12.8bn in debt. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1757.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:According to a person close to the company, Enron hopes within the next week to outline publicly the various off-balance-sheet debts and related-party transactions that have drawn the attention of the S.E.C. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:Enron has been under pressure since October 16, when management announced that the company had incurred a $1.01bn charge and $1.2bn reduction of shareholders' equity as a result of some off-balance sheet dealings. The company has also become the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation as a result of those dealings. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:Off-balance sheet entities affiliated to Enron owe $8bn-$9bn in debt. Enron itself is carrying $12.8bn in debt. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:Leading energy executives have been approached by institutional investors to consider forming a new management team, sources said Tuesday. Such a team would step in at Enron to work out its difficulties, which stem from transactions and obligations the company evidently made with at least 33 off-balance-sheet partnerships from which Enron managers profited. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly in August as Enron's CEO, was reported to be under subpoena to testify in Washington. Enron is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possibly failing to properly disclose off-balance-sheet partnerships to shareholders. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/inbox//1561.:The energy trading giant's credibility with investors has been badly tarnished and its stock price has sunk to lows last seen in 1992, as investors clamor for more information about off-balance sheet transactions. The dealings led to a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity that Enron disclosed three weeks ago.

But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing.

./maildir/kean-s/inbox//enron_mentions/4.:Enron established Marlin to facilitate off-balance sheet financing of the acquisition of Wessex Water Plc (Wessex). Azurix, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Enron, acquired Wessex in October 1998 for $2.4 billion through its direct subsidiary Azurix Europe Limited (AEL). Through a series of transactions, Enron contributed its ownership interest in Azurix to Atlantic Water Trust (AWT) in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in AWT. At the same time, Marlin acquired a 50% ownership interest in AWT with proceeds from the original Marlin issuance of senior notes ($1.15 billion) and trust certificates ($125 million). AWT applied the Marlin notes and certificates proceeds to repay a $900 million acquisition bridge loan and to establish a $249 million overfund account invested in Enron senior unsecured debt to pay note interest and certificate yield. In addition, Enron contributed to AWT its rights under a $125 million loan to AEL (rated `BBB+').

./maildir/kean-s/pr_crisis_management//27.:Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets. 
./maildir/kean-s/pr_crisis_management//99.:David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. "If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets," he wrote in a research note after the call. 
./maildir/kean-s/pr_crisis_management//99.:Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. 
./maildir/kean-s/pr_crisis_management//99.:Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets - including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy.

The financing vehicle contemplates the take-out of the vehicle upon the completion of construction.  The definition is in accordance with the construction contract.  Final completion of construction will not be completed until late December or early January in accordance with the construction contract due to the final completion of the water treatment facilities.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec/25.:Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec/25.:Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//portland/143.:I was incorrect.  The existing non-recourse debt for Las Vegas ($55MM) is off-balance sheet and off-credit.  It does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes.   If the plant blew up, we would be out $24MM, not $79MM.  We get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a Friend of Enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below 50%.  Our interest for control purposes is over 50% because we have a call option on the Friend of Enron shares.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//portland/115.:I spoke with Ben and he and I are in agreement.  We would be prepared to take the Mitsubishis into the EA turbine portfolio at cost.  Because they are off-balance sheet and interest gets capitalized, we think it makes sense to take a quarterly reserve approximating the actual interest charges.  In the event a turbine is "flipped", East, West and South share in the total gain.  We could establish upfront a transfer price, say cost + $3MM, for transfers into a project.  With everyone sharing in the pain and the gain, we should be able to make the optimal decision for EA.  
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//portland/128.:We are looking at submitting a notional offer later this week for Roseville (50MW-100MW, NP-15, 8-10 Years).  The big valuation question relates to ENA's bid for $.  Generally, we have paid over our cost of funds for this cash because it does not show up as debt.   In my discussions with Joe, he thinks our $ bid should be based on alternative markets for off-balance sheet cash, which might mean LIBOR plus 50-150 bp.   This sounds reasonable until I think of the fact that I am being charged 15% for balance sheet funds.  The bid/offer for balance sheet cash should not be 7%X15%.

But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//ooc/214.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.

We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:"We have had the opportunity to look under the hood of their core businesses and have found no surprises," said Bergstrom, who would be president of the combined company. Dynegy expects those businesses alone to add as much as 95 cents a share to the combined company's earnings the first year, and Dynegy has built protections into the deal if more surprises emerge from noncore businesses or off-balance-sheet partnerships, the executives said. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:Charles Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, said the deal included provisions that would protect his company's shareholders if large unexpected liabilities emerged at Enron. He added that he was confident that an investigation into the off-balance sheet transactions at Enron had left little uncovered. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:Enron got around these problems by setting up an off-balance sheet vehicle with a number of additional investors.

A lack of transparency from Enron about its off-balance-sheet transactions, along with a U.S. regulatory investigation, had sparked widespread investor unease. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:Enron's woes came to light in mid-October after the biggest energy trader in North America disclosed that some of its off-balance-sheet partners contributed to a $1-billion charge and a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:The Enron demise is one which cannot be blamed on the events of September 11. A third-quarter loss, followed by an equity write-down, the disclosure of questionable off-balance-sheet businesses, an admission that earnings have been over-stated and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation brought Enron to the brink of collapse. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/36.:Enron, currently North America's biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity, agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe into the off-balance sheet dealings, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/19.:This is because of complex off-balance sheet debt and ownership structures of Atlantic Water Trust and Marlin Trust. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/50.:However, a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company's financial structure.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/76.:Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/76.:The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:What has hammered Enron's securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off-balance-sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included, astonishingly enough, the chief financial officer, who was finally forced to go on leave. These partnership deals were never really disclosed, except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron yesterday marked four years of earnings down sharply after taking account of off-balance-sheet dealings.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:The company admitted that several of its off-balance-sheet, special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on its balance sheet. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:By reducing its earnings by more than $100m for several years, Enron has created concern about its ability to service debt. On the balance sheet, Enron owes $12.8bn. Off-balance-sheet entities related to Enron owe $8bn-$9bn. Enron generates about $3bn cashflow annually, but despite claiming to be cashflow-positive, its borrowings rose significantly last year. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:The question of the underlying value in Enron comes down to two risks: the contingent liabilities from the widely discussed off-balance-sheet vehicles that it used to swap assets for financings, and the safety of the trading accounts. The off-balance-sheet companies have already been combed over and their effects on the parent balance sheet restated, with the results reported yesterday. The contingent commitments do not affect the value of the assets backing Enron's debt. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron said it was terminating the employment of its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, both of whom, it said, were involved in limited partnerships that conducted off-balance-sheet deals with Enron. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron, a stock market star until this year, is fighting to restore the confidence of investors, creditors, customers and regulators following last month's ill-explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $1.2bn ( #820m) to meet off-balance-sheet obligations. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:The group said it and its auditors had also decided some off-balance entities should have been included in its prior financial statements. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron has provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with some more detail on concerns it had raised over the last three weeks, while the stock has declined 70 per cent. The $1.2bn equity charge relates to losses in LJM, the off-balance sheet private equity fund run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer. These, in turn, arise from a group of special purpose entities that LJM used to hedge risk associated with Enron's investment in a bankrupt broadband company. The charges resulted when the hedges were closed. All clear, then?
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:What emerges from the filing is an off-balance sheet mess of interlinking financing vehicles. The difficulty in unravelling it might be part of the reason why JP Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney insisted that their last loan should be secured with assets. No doubt other lenders would like similar security. More clearly, Enron admits that three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated. That means the earnings statements over the last five years were worthless. Enron has now reduced net income by a cumulative $600m for 1997-2000, not the kind of thing that reassures ratings agencies. Mr Fastow's resignation will leave him with more time to spend with the $30m he received for running the LJM partnerships. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Dynegy would assume $12.8 billion in Enron debt, which does not include the off-balance-sheet partnerships, the sources said. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Enron's shares have lost 90% of their value this year, going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director Andrew Fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off-balance sheet. These forced it to take a $1bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $1.2bn. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:Now, in no small part because of its executives' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts, Enron's reputation is in tatters, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off-balance-sheet transactions, its once high-flying stock has tanked, its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:THE crisis surrounding Enron, the beleaguered American energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in Britain, deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off-balance-sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/42.:ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, BUSINESS UNUSUAL: The energy trading giant Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is restating its earnings downward. This announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/48.:The company's stock has more than halved in value since mid-October and its credit has been downgraded after it emerged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating off-balance-sheet transactions that led to a $1 billion charge and a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/48.:Enron, which dominates natural gas and electricity markets in the United States, has come under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following disclosures that it did off-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:In a publicly disclosed example, an Enron off-balance-sheet financial affiliate - Whitewing Associates - owns 250,000 shares of Enron convertible preferred stock, which are good upon conversion in January 2003 for 50 million shares of Enron common stock at a guaranteed minimum value of $48.55 a share. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:In recent weeks Enron's stock has plunged amid investor unease about disclosures of off-balance sheet deals involving its former chief financial officer. The deals are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:A report in the Wall Street Journal on Friday said Dynegy is close to buying Enron, currently under investigation after disclosures of off-balance sheet deals, for $7 billion.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:The company says, "Certain off balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron`s consolidated financial statements; $591 million in earnings disappears, the stock closes $8.41. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:The stock, which has fallen more than 73 percent since the company disclosed off-balance-sheet deals that are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was up 79 cents, or 9.4 percent, to $9.20 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:"We are quite sure the impact of Enron's off-balance-sheet investments were material and not adequately disclosed," said Stock. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/41.:Enron's stock and credit ratings have plunged since disclosures of off-balance-sheet deals now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/64.:Investor anger has been focused on Enron executives who still have much to explain about several off-balance-sheet vehicles and potential conflicts of interest for the company's former chief financial officer. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/64.:The real questions are whether there are more troubling partnerships the company still hasn't revealed and if they will lead to more write-downs or charges such as those that occurred last quarter. Moody's officials said they will continue to review those off-balance-sheet transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/45.:Hidden from investors by off-balance sheet transactions are billions of dollars of derivative contracts that Enron has entered into with banks and investment firms as well as other energy companies. Some are hedging transactions while others are contracts to sell a commodity at a specific price at some time in the future. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/45.:Enron is under attack over investor unease about its off-balance sheet transactions that led to a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/45.:Off-balance sheet vehicles affiliated to Enron have $8-$9bn in debt. Enron itself is carrying $12.8bn in debt. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/60.:Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade attributed the jump in Enron's stock to investors attracted by its low price. Those buyers, he said, are hoping not to be hit by the "double swords" hanging over the Houston energy trader -- a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with an off-balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit-rating downgrade by Moody's, which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/31.:With its stock falling to new lows and its credit rating battered, energy giant Enron is desperately searching for new capital. Sources close to the Houston company say it's considering deals with other energy-trading companies, private-equity firms, and blue-chip saviors such as GE Capital. The Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported that Dynegy is in merger talks with Enron. The company's financial crisis was sparked by disclosures about some of its off-balance-sheet partnership deals negotiated by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. A Securities & Exchange Commission investigation and the threat of liabilities from shareholder lawsuits could make it tough for Enron to land a new investor.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/31.:The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal ways of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This week, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems "had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balance sheet". America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking again at off-balance-sheet financing, having fretted about it on and off for a decade. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/31.:Enron shares began falling in September, as news emerged that the company's financial statements were more complex than investors realised, featuring several off-balance sheet partnerships, now under SEC investigation.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/32.:Enron has been under the gun from Wall Street since mid-October when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $1.2 billion because of off-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was later replaced. The deals are under investigation by U.S. regulators.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/32.:Dynegy agreed to buy its larger cross-town rival after Enron investors lost faith in the company whose stock plummeted following its disclosure of off-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/32.:Once a Wall Street high-flyer boasting a $90 share price just 15 months ago, Enron fell from grace after off-balance sheet transactions and financial reporting lapses prompted a regulatory investigation and senior official resignations. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/32.:Enron agreed on Friday to be taken over by Dynegy for about $9 billion in stock, after investor unease over Enron's off-balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $7 last week from a high of $90.56 in August 2000. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/32.:Enron agreed on Friday to be taken over by Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock after investor unease over off-balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $7 last week from a high of $90.56 in August 2000. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:Granted, this is very much a sideshow both to the H-P/Compaq deal and Enron's own quagmire, in which the company wiped out $586 million worth of earnings Thursday by admitting that some off-balance-sheet entities should have been on Enron's balance sheet after all. But given the shellshock that H-P, Compaq and Enron shareholders have been through this week, they deserve more of an explanation about this from Lay than a quiet, after-the-fact SEC filing. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is understood to have approved the controversial off-balance sheet arrangement used by Enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:In a regulatory filing late last week, Enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off-balance companies was based on current information, implying full details had not been available before. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:An Andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off-balance sheet arrangements. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/38.:Comment: Dynegy presumably has been given a fuller and franker explanation of Enron's off-balance sheet mess than its investors, but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/71.:"Enron needs to be more forthcoming with its off-balance-sheet deals and transparent with its financial statements in order to answer its critics," Plaza said.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/17.:Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/55.:Moody's, a rating agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above "junk" level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/55.:Enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the S.E.C. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. Enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/55.:On Octoberm, 16 Enron management announced a Dollars 1.01bn charge and a Dollars 1.2bn reduction of shareholders equity as a result of off-balance sheet private equity transactions set up by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/55.:Questions about some off-balance sheet deals with two partnerships helped pummel the company's stock this week to its lowest level since 1992, shrinking market capitalization to less than $9 billion from more than $60 billion in January. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:Mr. Lay also noted that much of his net worth is tied up in Enron, shares of which tumbled by as much as 80% during the past several weeks alone. Enron shocked investors Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron. Shares of Enron traded at $9.98, up 74 cents, or 8%, on the Big Board as of 4 p.m. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:Enron, once valued at $80 billion, has seen its shares lose 80pc in the past three weeks after announcing a $586m loss, an equity write-down and a regulatory inquiry into off balance sheet dealings.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:For the past several months Enron had been using its clout with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its terms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:"I'm not persuaded that you'll find anything illegal," Watson said Tuesday, commenting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into Enron's off-balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:Concerns about Enron's dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships like JEDI II drove the company's stock price down 80% in the three weeks before the merger was announced. Its credit ratings were also downgraded to one level above junk. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/33.:Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/5.:Enron's almost certain demise - or substantially altered business under any bankruptcy reorganization - would harm others and wipe out whatever hope equity investors had of recouping some of the $60 billion or so they've lost on Enron's stock this year. (Bondholders and bank lenders get paid first in most bankruptcy proceedings. Stockholders rarely receive anything.) And trading outfits and banks that entered into complicated derivative deals with Enron stand to get burned. The whole affair may even end up changing the way courts and regulators deal with derivatives and the myriad off-balance-sheet items that first got Enron into trouble. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/5.:That's because Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) decision Wednesday to abandon its plan to rescue Enron all but sealed the fate of the ailing Houston energy trader which has been hobbled by accounting irregularities and unquantified off-balance-sheet liabilities. Enron shares plummeted from about $90 a share last summer to 36 cents Thursday. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/5.:The troubled U.S. energy group, which boasted revenue of $101 billion in 2002, is on the verge of bankruptcy after surprising off-balance sheet disclosures triggered a share price collapse. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/56.:Other traders said they believed part of the recent run-up in gas prices was due to a steady spate of short-covering in recent days by Enron, whose share price has been hammered after a series of disclosures about off-balance-sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/73.:JP Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said he has downgraded the stock to a 'long-term buy' from a 'buy' in "the wake of lingering concerns regarding the company's credit situation and management disclosure of liabilities stemming from off-balance sheet financing vehicles."

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/68.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/47.:Enron has been under pressure since October 16, when management announced that the company had incurred a $1.01bn charge and $1.2bn reduction of shareholders' equity as a result of some off-balance sheet dealings. The company has also become the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation as a result of those dealings.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/47.:Leading energy executives have been approached by institutional investors to consider forming a new management team, sources said Tuesday. Such a team would step in at Enron to work out its difficulties, which stem from transactions and obligations the company evidently made with at least 33 off-balance-sheet partnerships from which Enron managers profited. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/47.:Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly in August as Enron's CEO, was reported to be under subpoena to testify in Washington.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/43.:The cut in Enron Corp's (ENE) credit rating and a Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships was making the energy giant's coal customers anxious about getting paid, people in the market said.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/43.:HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/43.:  The key to Enron's restatement is the treatment of three off balance sheet
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/25.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/66.:Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/49.:Fitch's downgrade flew in the face of an intensive campaign by Enron to convince the rating agencies its business was sound despite a crises of confidence since October 16, when the Texas-based company disclosed an off balance sheet adjustment that shocked the market.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/52.:No longer, of course. Enron stunned investors on Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss, and since then it has revealed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships, some involving the company's own executives. Enron says its board has formed an independent committee to review the transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/52.:To be sure, the adequacy of a company's related-party disclosures can be determined only when all the information about the transactions is out in the open. For its part, Enron -- which is hardly the only large energy company with complex partnership dealings -- maintains its off-balance-sheet transactions were legal and properly disclosed. "They comply with reporting requirements," says Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne, adding that Andersen was aware of the transactions and reviewed them. "To the extent that an investor doesn't understand them, they are able to ask questions." And in the end, she notes, investors who didn't understand the transactions didn't have to buy Enron stock. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/52.:"I don't see how that possibly hedges any of Enron's risks or assets," Mr. Carmichael says. Indeed, the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that Enron's actual purpose was to use its off-balance-sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement. Asked whether that was Enron's purpose, Ms. Denne declines to comment. She says Enron stands by its earlier statement that Enron was trying to hedge certain investments.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/2.:Let's start with Sunday's filing, which notes that Enron has $13.15 billion in debt - but acknowledges that that amount "does not reflect off-balance-sheet and contingent obligations." 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/2.:All this ambiguity only lends credence to the idea that even Enron is having trouble getting its arms around the tangled financial structure that made the company nearly impossible for even Wall Street's savviest minds to understand. And the missing information about the off-balance-sheet debts and the creditors' claims, in particular, suggests that Enron's search for unencumbered assets to back its new financing may be more difficult and chaotic than the company had hoped. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/51.:Today's rating action reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence. This follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments, which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off-balance sheet vehicles. Enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment, ultimately recognizing the values of the company's core businesses.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/51.:Fitch said its rating action Monday reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/12.:People began looking at Enron more closely, especially since October when a series of negative disclosures about the company's finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off-balance sheet transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/12.:In fact, the biggest risks to stocks remain the same as they were yesterday or last week or last month. They're fundamentals unrelated to what's going on at Enron, whose problems started with questionable off-balance sheet transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/74.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas//sec_media/74.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.

In this particular matter, we are attempting to deal with an on vs off balance sheet issue.  I realize that your commercial issues don't always work with the accounting, but in that case I would hope you would simply communicate that fact and then we could jointly decide whether we should finance this deal on balance sheet or not, given the size of opportunity you have.  By the way, have you involved Joe Deffner or Brian Kerrigan from ENA Treasury.
./maildir/lavorato-j/deleted_items//295.:Matthew, with all due respect, clients will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on this issue.

As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

None of these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

./maildir/lavorato-j/inbox//246.:I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.
./maildir/lavorato-j/powerwest//12.:I was incorrect.  The existing non-recourse debt for Las Vegas ($55MM) is off-balance sheet and off-credit.  It does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes.   If the plant blew up, we would be out $24MM, not $79MM.  We get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a Friend of Enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below 50%.  Our interest for control purposes is over 50% because we have a call option on the Friend of Enron shares.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//32.:     ``They had to do more off-balance-sheet financings, to get the debt off the books, to present the right balance sheet that Wall Street wanted to see,'' said Danny Bowers, chief investment officer for the Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund, which manages about $1.7 billion and represents 5,000 firefighters and retirees in Houston.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//32.:Enron directors, among other things, failed to question the company's use of off-balance sheet financings to cover up debt and losses. The directors also waived conflict-of-interest rules to allow Enron executives to create limited partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction, and they approved the annual report without confirming it was "straightforward and comprehensible," the AFL-CIO said.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//32.:He criticized board members for their failure to raise questions about "Enron's extensive use of off-balance-sheet entities to remove debt and losses" from financial statements and "for the company's overall lack of transparency." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//32.:Enron LNG Shipping Co., in a late Thursday filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, listed total assets of $952,099 and total debts of $935,331, excluding off-balance sheet transactions and contingent obligations.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:Mr. Lay also noted that much of his net worth is tied up in Enron, shares of which tumbled by as much as 80% during the past several weeks alone. Enron shocked investors Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron. Shares of Enron traded at $9.98, up 74 cents, or 8%, on the Big Board as of 4 p.m. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:Enron, once valued at $80 billion, has seen its shares lose 80pc in the past three weeks after announcing a $586m loss, an equity write-down and a regulatory inquiry into off balance sheet dealings.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:For the past several months Enron had been using its clout with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its terms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transactions. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:"I'm not persuaded that you'll find anything illegal," Watson said Tuesday, commenting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into Enron's off-balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:Concerns about Enron's dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships like JEDI II drove the company's stock price down 80% in the three weeks before the merger was announced. Its credit ratings were also downgraded to one level above junk. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//207.:Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off-balance sheet deals now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//40.:Questions regarding an off-balance sheet financing vehicle run by Fastow sparked the initial inquiry into Enron's finances by the Securities and Exchange commission. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//40.:On the outside, he said, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//40.:The SEC hasn't said what might trigger concerns, but officials noted the agency has highlighted the need for better management discussion and analysis in corporate annual reports, including of off-balance sheet items and related party transactions, two areas that tripped up Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//40.:Even before Enron's collapse, critics complained its financial reports obscured the company's real condition and have called for more disclosure of off-balance sheet items and deals.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//11.:At Senate Energy Committee hearings Tuesday, an energy consultant from the Northwest, Robert McCullough, made a reasonable pitch for more transparency in energy markets and for enforced disclosure of all corporations' off-balance sheet subsidiaries. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//11.:Enron Property & Services Corp., in court documents, listed assets of $358.6 million and debts of $194 million, not including off-balance sheet and contingent obligations. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//37.:Dozens of banks, brokerage firms, pension funds and institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings, but could not share the information with their brokerage clients, according to the Times.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//18.:McMahon is said to have openly questioned some of the major off-balance sheet partnerships set up by Enron that contributed to the energy giant filing the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in December. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//18.:As a company insider, he understands the inner workings of Enron's complex dealings. That asset could help Enron in its survival strategy. But it could also prove to be a liability, if inquiries about off-balance sheet structures raise concerns about McMahon's involvement. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//18.:According to a letter sent from Sherron Watkins, a vice president at Enron, to former Chairman Kenneth Lay, which was written after Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, McMahon was highly concerned about the off-balance sheet LJM partnerships, a series of deals set up by Enron.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//18.:This joins Cooper, an outsider with a restructuring background, with McMahon, an insider not implicated directly in any wrongdoing. Still, McMahon was a senior financial official while a series of off-balance-sheet transactions were structured, and many of them had cross investments in one another, a banker who knows McMahon said. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items//18.:McMahon has so far successfully avoided criticism for his involvement with off-balance sheet structures, the banker said. "But who knows if he'll get dragged into this?," he added.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//313.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//313.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//96.:NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:At an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of "on-balance and off-balance sheet debt," according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of "accounting scrutiny" on the Raptor partnership. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:The other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:At an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as "the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt." Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:At a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. "Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:The company, burdened by off-balance-sheet transactions that hid millions of dollars of debt, filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, leaving thousands of employees and shareholders in the lurch. Top executives, though, cashed in hundreds of millions of dollars in stock they held in the months leading up to Enron's collapse. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:Asked about the questionable off-balance-sheet transactions and accounting practices that sank Enron, Mr. Cooper declined to comment. "Not only do I not know" what brought the company down, he said, "but it's literally of no interest to me." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:Mr. Cooper did acknowledge that the company's creditors, in the end, are likely to be treated disparately because of the "extensive nature of the legal entities in the Enron universe." In other words, Enron pledged so many assets to so many different companies, especially as it created a web of off-balance-sheet partnerships, many creditors may find there isn't enough left to meet their claims. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:The company is also searching for an auditor to replace accounting firm Arthur Andersen, said Enron Chief Operating Officer Jeff McMahon. Andersen, the firm that has worked with Enron for more than a decade and has given the company the stamp of approval on dozens of questionable off-balance-sheet partnerships, stopped working with Enron last week. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//53.:US energy firm Williams lost 22 per cent, to US$18.78, after saying it would delay an earnings report. Diversified Cendant, owner of Avis rental cars, lost 9.97 per cent with worries about its seven off-balance-sheet funding entities, which resemble Enron's.

Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//466.:Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//120.:One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron's heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron's financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//282.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations.

The company also built up its reputation through a mix of deceit, hobnobbing and bravado. Its high credit rating was maintained by hiding billions of dollars of debt in off-balance sheet partnerships. Its gravy train included prominent economists, politicians and journalists. By dint of ceaseless self-promotion, executives like Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling made Enron's name synonymous with successful financial innovation. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//489.:Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox//88.:WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Federal regulators told companies on Tuesday as they prepare their annual reports that better disclosure is needed for off-balance sheet deals and other accounting methods associated with fallen energy trader Enron Corp. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//88.:Tuesday's SEC statement reminded companies of current disclosure requirements and suggested steps that they should consider in meeting the requirements for liquidity and capital resources, including off-balance sheet arrangements, as well as the effects of transactions with related parties. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//88.:People reading Enron's financial statements were left scratching their heads in confusion over the company's off-balance sheet deals. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//88.:In the wake of Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) financial collapse, which included a $569 million earnings restatement, the Big Five firms suggested the SEC consider specific areas dealing with off-balance sheet transactions, over-the-counter derivatives contracts and related party transactions. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox//88.:With respect to off-balance sheet arrangements, the SEC said companies should consider providing disclosures concerning transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity or the availability of capital. Specifically, companies should mention arrangements that contractually limit their ability to transfer or access assets.

./maildir/may-l/inbox//1119.:Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
./maildir/may-l/inbox//1119.:Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:
./maildir/may-l/inbox//604.:Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items//348.: had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items//118.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items//64.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items//64.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items//78.:Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.

./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//197.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance- sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.
./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//197.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix (news/quote), an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors "have determined there is no write-down required," he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.
./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//745.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//54.:Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//38.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items//819.:Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings.

./maildir/shankman-j/inbox//100.:The SO2 Emissions Credits Inventory transaction with Barclays Bank PLC has been extended for 12 more months as of yesterday, November 6. Barclays has arranged a facility of $170 million, of which $158 million was used as of yesterday. As a condition of extending the term past yesterday, Barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an L/C from an acceptable bank. We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items//501.:Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items//501.:Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items//686.:If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade.

./maildir/shapiro-r/notre_dame//12.:Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

./maildir/skilling-j/deleted_items//292.:We are currently trying to close the second part of this deal which involves a demand-side management program. In essence we estimate that we would invest about $20-22mm in capital (thru off-balance sheet operating leases) to reduce their demand and provide them with about $27mm in nominal savings over the next 10 years. This translates into guaranteed savings to them $2.8mm/yr for the first 5 years and then $2.6mm/yr for the back 5 years.

./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//278.:Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//273.:Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//273.:Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:
./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//277.:Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//277.:Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
./maildir/townsend-j/inbox//277.:Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.

./maildir/watson-k/deleted_items//353.:of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships that 
./maildir/watson-k/deleted_items//349.:    Former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who had opposed the accounting practices that led to the downfall of the energy trading giant, apparently took his own life early Friday morning. Police said that Baxter was dead at the scene and the only occupant of the car. A suicide note and a revolver were found at the scene. Baxter was chairman and CEO of Enron North America before being named chief strategy officer. In October of 2000, he was promoted to vice chairman. Baxter resigned last May after ten years with Enron, during which time he helped build its wholesale energy business. Baxter had disagreed with then CEO Jeffrey Skilling over the inappropriateness of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships that ultimately brought the company down. Baxter was one of the Enron directors targeted in about 40 investor lawsuits which allege that the company concealed losses by the use of the partnerships. Baxter engineered the $3.21 billion purchase of Portlan!
./maildir/watson-k/e_mail_bin//149.:shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transactions, 
./maildir/watson-k/e_mail_bin//156.:    Enrons 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower than the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt for a third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the period. Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October through December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd quarter. Last week, the FERC began investigating allegations that Enron unfairly raised wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. After Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transactions, other energy firms limited their trading with Enron out of concern credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of 2001, Enron had about 15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP was next in line with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's biggest customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each for the 4th quarter. <BR>

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox//20.:Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox//421.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox//495.:Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox//18.:Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.
