./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/661.:According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements.

Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes.

./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/517.:The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.

./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/445.:In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/445.:After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
./maildir/arnold-j/deleted_items/445.:During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships.

During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/steffes-j/deleted_items/579.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures.

As you know, the Commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled "Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations" (presumably being done under the Commission's section 206 authorization).  EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

./maildir/steffes-j/sent_items/2207.:Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.

./maildir/steffes-j/california_issues/238.:The Contracts Clause only applies to contracts that exist at the time of the law's passage.  Also, the Contracts Clause has been deemed to apply both to legislation or other government action, but not to court decisions.  The judiciary has the power to invalidate a contract without violating the Contracts Clause.  See Tidal Oil v. Flanagan, 263 U.S. 444 (1924).  In a case involving a private contract, the law or governmental action must substantially impair a pre-existing contractual relationship.  Once this hurdle is met, the government must demonstrate that the law imposes reasonable conditions appropriate to achieving a significant and legitimate public purpose.  Often, when faced with such an issue, the courts defer to the legislative judgment.  However, this does not prevent an independent investigation of the relevant factual situation.

./maildir/steffes-j/california_issues/western_gas/32.:The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a "more complete investigation" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is "an abuse of process," the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. 
./maildir/steffes-j/california_issues/western_gas/32.:In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
./maildir/steffes-j/california_issues/western_gas/32.:The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel "seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head," the companies said. 
./maildir/steffes-j/california_issues/western_gas/32.:MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed "potential violations" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be "other potential explanations" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. "We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001." MOE conceded its motion was an "unusual" move.

./maildir/kaminski-v/inbox/37.:The focus of investigations into the collapse of Enron turned to its derivatives trading business this week. Expert testimony in a US Senate hearing Thursday by Frank Partnoy, a professor in the University of San Diego School of Law, warned that profits the firm attributed to its derivatives operations may have been inflated due to systematic problems with the way Enron valued its positions and recorded them in its trading book. But Partnoy - who is currently researching a book about Enron's fall - failed to provide any hard evidence. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer refused to address the matter, stating Enron would not offer counterarguments to each testimony.

./maildir/skilling-j/deleted_items/379.:LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons familiar with the probe said Monday.
./maildir/skilling-j/deleted_items/379.:California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night, spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing.

Following the recent shift in control of the Senate to Democrats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that the FERC has failed to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the matter. President Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price caps, arguing they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do nothing to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation, Lieberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into the oil industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices.
./maildir/germany-c/deleted_items/142.:    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by El Paso is still proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the California PUC have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing looks no closer to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It dutifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spreads. As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of political economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Brattle's tale doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 conditions must be met: * The system for getting gas to California must not be full; * El Paso Merchant must have unutilized, but available, delivery rights; and * Other shippers!
./maildir/germany-c/inbox/130.:    The Justice Department is investigating whether AES and Williams violated antitrust laws by agreeing to limit expansion of some AES plants. The DOJ launched an investigation last month focusing on a deal between AES Southland and Williams Energy Services. It alleges that the agreement limits the expansion of electric generating capacity at or near certain plants owned by AES Southland. AES has been ordered to answer questions and turn over documents related to the case. Williams markets power produced by two AES Southland generation plants under a 20-year agreement. Williams supplies natural gas and receives the electric output in return for fixed fees from AES. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle accusations that it withheld electricity produced at two AES generating plants in southern California from the ISO.

If you should be contacted in regard to this matter, I encourage you to contact Bob Williams in our legal group at 713-345-2402.

./maildir/germany-c/sent_items/1334.:Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.

This case adds additional cause for concern among Texas employers dealing with allegations of employee misconduct and, in conjunction with other recent cases regarding such investigations, indicates a further erosion of the at-will employment doctrine.

My sense is that Ben, after his investigation, thinks there are gaps, including credibility gaps, in our defense.

./maildir/cash-m/inbox/258.:Although Ms. Davis was terminated for undermining the brass-in, brass-out rule by leaving her station, the investigation revealed several mitigating circumstances for her actions.  One, the power was out completely.  She previously had indicated a fear of working on the site at night, but she had no flashlight or any way to reach anybody from the site.  Second, there is the contention that the security guard came by and told her to leave.  Third, this offense is not a terminable one under the NEPCO progressive discipline policy (although of course that policy provides for flexibility based on the circumstances).  Ben's investigation revealed some other reasons why he was concerned about how Ms. Davis had been treated; he can provide detail, if we want.

Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans.

./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/78.:In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/78.:After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67.

./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/78.:During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships.

But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep.

./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.

./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/mccarty-d/deleted_items/333.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.

The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.

./maildir/dasovich-j/deleted_items/2014.:In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/deleted_items/2014.:The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel "seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head," the companies said. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/deleted_items/2014.:MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed "potential violations" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be "other potential explanations" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. "We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001." MOE conceded its motion was an "unusual" move.

The probe would focus on why a state agency may have ordered Edison International's utility to reduce output at a plant in Nevada. 
./maildir/dasovich-j/deleted_items/1777.:The state Department of Water Resources would be a target of the investigation, Pendexter said. The department may have sought to slow production at the Mojave power plant, she said.

The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.

Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law.

Also, the Contracts Clause has been deemed to apply both to legislation or other government action, but not to court decisions.  The judiciary has the power to invalidate a contract without violating the Contracts Clause.  See Tidal Oil v. Flanagan, 263 U.S. 444 (1924).  In a case involving a private contract, the law or governmental action must substantially impair a pre-existing contractual relationship.  Once this hurdle is met, the government must demonstrate that the law imposes reasonable conditions appropriate to achieving a significant and legitimate public purpose.  Often, when faced with such an issue, the courts defer to the legislative judgment.  However, this does not prevent an independent investigation of the relevant factual situation.

In recent weeks, Enron's labyrinth of financial transactions, particularly with members of company management, has come under intense scrutiny from investors and regulators, who are seeking information about the impact of the transactions on the company and whether Enron adequately disclosed the deals to the public.

Already, Enron's dealings with the partnerships are the subject of a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That creates the possibility that Andersen itself could become a focus of the probe at some point, should regulators find Enron's accounting and disclosure practices deficient.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/95.:Enron sets up a committee to conduct an investigation of its accounting.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/84.:Broadly speaking, Mr. Pitt is resolute about his regulatory approach. Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has made a career of riding herd on regulators he deems soft, recently wrote Mr. Pitt to blast him for "repudiating" the Levitt legacy, and to demand a tough investigation of Enron, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code earlier this month. Mr. Pitt replied that he was "perplexed" by Mr. Dingell's assertions; as he sees it, in fact, the Levitt commission's "adversarial attitude toward industry and professions in almost all respects" sowed the seeds of the Enron mess. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/84.:But the Enron case offers the most visible opportunity for defining Mr. Pitt as an enforcer. He has made it a high priority, assigning a team of about six attorneys and accountants to unravel the company's complicated books, according to a person familiar with the probe. He pesters probers for regular progress reports, and even questions investigation strategy at times, according to this person. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/84.:Mr. Pitt has said he intends to make Enron an example of his push for "real time" enforcement, to speed up the slow pace of some SEC investigations. But Gregory Bruch, a former SEC enforcement attorney, says Enron's involvement with partnerships and extensive energy-derivatives trading probably would take a year for the SEC to unravel. The SEC would have to "cut corners" to bring a case more quickly, perhaps naming fewer defendants than it otherwise might. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/84.:Yet even as Mr. Pitt stands to be judged for the SEC's handling of the Enron matter, the case holds particular complications for him that will restrict the chairman's own role. If the commission staff ultimately does recommend filing an enforcement action against Enron, Mr. Pitt must recuse himself at that point because a former client, Arthur Andersen LLP, also is under SEC investigation for its role as Enron's auditor.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee became the fourth congressional panel to launch an Enron-related probe, joining the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:"Thorough investigations are needed, and from different perspectives, to determine whether current law was violated and where current law is inadequate to protect the public interest," he said. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Lieberman said the Enron investigation will be a committee priority when it returns from recess later this month. That appears to be true for much of Congress as well as federal regulatory agencies. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Since Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2, the Senate Commerce Committee, the House Financial Services Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and now the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have launched investigations. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:The SEC and Labor investigations could result in civil charges while the Justice Department's inquiries could result in criminal charges. "We'll do our best to coordinate with our colleagues," Lieberman said. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Levin said overlapping investigations do not worry him. "There is more than enough work for the House and the Senate," Levin said after the news conference. "The problem is there is so much to look at that there may be some pieces not investigated. That's my fear." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:While Lieberman said the committee has not decided whether to ask Enron chairman Kenneth Lay or other company executives to testify, he did note that he "wouldn't consider an investigation complete without hearing from them." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:More investigation A Congressional committee has announced that it will open an investigation of Enron's business practices. The bankrupt energy conglomerate is the subject of various investigations, including one begun in October by the SEC.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:"We're hoping that this investigation will contribute to equity finally being given to the stockholders and the employees of Enron," Levin added. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron's business practices had the mark of "a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest," says a senator who plans to subpoena documents as part of a broad investigation into the energy company's collapse. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said his committee will within weeks subpoena documents from Enron's board of directors, senior managers and its auditing firm.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is among a half dozen committees and subcommittees expected to hold hearings in both the House and Senate in the coming months on Enron's collapse, one of the largest ever. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also have investigations under way.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations will subpoena documents next week and hold a hearing on Jan. 24.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Enron was a major backer of President Bush's election campaign. "There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration, but that is not the focus of this investigation," said Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse; accounting firm Andersen, which audited Enron's financial statements; and the company's use of complex financial partnerships. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by at least five congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the departments of Justice and Labor. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:The money went to the organization that aids Senate Democratic candidates, but a recently hired attorney for Enron insisted the donations were unrelated to congressional investigations. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Government regulators, outside auditors, and equity analysts will share the hot seat with Enron officials when Sens. Lieberman and Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the panel's permanent subcommittee on investigations, begin their probe Jan. 24.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, next week as part of an investigation into the financial collapse of Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/80.:When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/63.:The fact that there's no credible indication as yet that anyone in the Bush administration did anything improper about Enron isn't going to slow down the story one bit. The questions the Bushies face over Enron are at least as legitimate as the questions their predecessors the Clintonites faced for years over the Whitewater affair, and after congressional Republicans battered Bill Clinton for years with investigation after investigation, you'd better believe the Democrats are smelling payback. (Of course, the Democrats have to tread carefully; many of them got contributions from Enron too.)

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:Lay isn't required to report the details of the transactions until Feb. 14, the letter noted. The lawmakers asked for the information by Jan. 28 to assist the committee's "intensive investigation of the demise of the company." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:Enron, a Texas-based company with deep ties to President George W. Bush, filed for bankruptcy late last year after investors and workers lost fortunes in company stocks. Bush, a friend of former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, ordered a review of the nation's pension laws and approved a Justice Department criminal investigation into the company's actions. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:Arthur Andersen, which kept the company's books, is also under investigation. Congress is holding hearings on the Enron collapse. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to stifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a House panel concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps most devastating bankruptcy in history.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:Trumka noted Enron's bankruptcy filing, multiple investigations into its accounting practices and the "evaporation" of $70 billion in market capitalization. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/32.:An Enron spokesman said it was premature to make comments about issues under investigation. Individual board members either didn't immediately return a call for comment or couldn't immediately be reached.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/207.:The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:In his email to employees Wednesday, Lay cited the distractions caused by "multiple inquiries and investigations" as one factor contributing to his decision to resign. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Enron is facing multiple congressional and federal investigations over its collapse, which threw thousands of employees out of work and devastated investors, including employees whose pension plans were heavily invested in Enron stock.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       Last week, Andersen fired Duncan because of his role in Enron-related document destruction in October and November, just as Enron's problems were publicly emerging and the SEC began a formal investigation. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       "Mr. Duncan seeks the full disclosure of the truth" and will continue to cooperate with the congressional investigations as well as those by the Justice Department and the SEC, Giuffra wrote.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the full committee, said the panel did not want to impede a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, so it rejected the immunity request as well as a request by Duncan that he not be required to appear.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       "Our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents - and in doing so, he gave every appearance of destroying these materials in anticipation of a government request for documents," the two said.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       "The case of Mr. Duncan was clear enough to allow us to draw conclusions about his responsibility at an early stage of the inquiry. That is not true of other Andersen personnel who were involved with the destruction of documents," the two Andersen executives told the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:       "Our investigation into the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel is far from complete," they said.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:     Lay's resignation comes amid a dozen government investigations and more than 50 civil lawsuits into Enron's collapse. The company filed bankruptcy Dec. 2 and fired more than 4,500 employees after it admitted overstating profit by $586 million since 1997.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:He remains on Enron's board of directors, but is scheduled to testify before Congress next month and faces numerous civil lawsuits and a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:The bankrupt energy giant is facing investigations by congressional committees and the Securities and Exchange Commission. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has subpoenaed the company regarding his investigation into last year's price spikes in the wholesale energy market.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, announced his resignation late Wednesday, saying the many investigations into the company's collapse would require too much of his attention.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Last week, Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, fired the lead partner on the Enron account, David B. Duncan, saying he orchestrated widespread document destruction shortly after learning of a government investigation into Enron's finances.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:But Mr. Greenwood expressed skepticism on Wednesday about that account. "Do you believe that 80 Andersen employees were directed by Mr. Duncan to violate an express provision of policy by Andersen in the face of yet another investigation, and none of them picked up the phone and called their superiors and said, `This doesn't seem right'?" he asked. "The question we need to get to is, Were there instructions from above."
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Other people close to the investigation said they doubted that the number of Andersen employees was as high as Mr. Greenwood's estimate, but they said it was a much larger group than the company had suggested. Mr. Duncan appeared today under subpoena at the energy and commerce subcommittee hearing, but as expected, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. His lawyer, Robert Giuffra, told the committee in a letter on Wednesday, that Mr. Duncan would "rely on his Constitutional right not to testify" unless he is given immunity.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:One week later, officials in Andersen's Houston office began to shred Enron-related documents on a massive scale, even though Enron had just disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation into its finances. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan last week, saying he had ordered the destruction of the Enron papers.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:"The one glaring fact here is that David Duncan, with full knowledge of an S.E.C. investigation, initiated a massive document destruction campaign," official said.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:In the House, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee cross-examined senior Arthur Andersen officials about why the firm destroyed Enron documents after learning about an S.E.C. investigation into the company's finances.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:A Justice Department official said that he had not seen Mr. Conyers's letter and that officials were still proceeding with their criminal investigation.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:In an interview, Mr. Greenwood said Mr. Duncan had sought immunity for his testimony but had been rebuffed. Justice Department officials are worried that grants of immunity made by Congress might hamper their criminal investigation of Enron and Andersen.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employees in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Lawmakers on the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee described on Thursday what they called widespread and systematic effort to shred Enron-related documents at the company's accounting firm and charged that the practice, which was later suspended, has impeded investigations and could lead to criminal charges. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Tauzin said before the hearing that it is likely criminal charges will be filed because of indications that both Enron and Anderson shredded financial documents after Enron filed for bankruptcy and as it faced numerous investigations and lawsuits. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:"Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:The company's collapse has sparked a Justice Department probe and numerous congressional investigations. The company and its executives have been the single biggest group of contributors to President Bush and other Republican campaigns, and they have donated to many Democratic lawmakers as well. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Anderson last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Anderson-Enron engagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions. Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse, and if so, did you do so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Anderson or at Enron? 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys for Arthur Andersen LLP have given the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy permission to disclose that in November 2001 the Board opened an official investigation into Andersen's audit of Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:that an investigation is underway; 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:The Texas Board's disciplinary process begins with a complaint, filed either by a member of the public, another government entity, or on the Board's own initiative. A staff investigation follows, sometimes with the assistance of an outside technical consultant. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:The Texas Board designates certain investigations as "major cases." These involve CPA firms implicated in the audits of failed or troubled savings and loan organizations, financial institutions, insurance companies, and other cases of a major nature. Such cases are more complex and require substantial resources for pre-hearing preparations and prosecution. The Texas Board engages the Texas Attorney General's office to assist in the prosecutorial process. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:     The bill's backers said multiple investigations into Enron Corp., which gave almost $6 million to federal candidates since 1989, helped win support from a majority of the 435 lawmakers.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:Enron, formerly ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500, went bankrupt last year after announcing it had overstated four-and-a-half years' worth of earnings. The Houston energy company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department and various congressional committees. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/40.:If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice.

./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Lawmakers will hear from two Enron board members next week. Congressional committees probing the matter expect testimony from William Powers, who headed an internal investigation, and Robert Jaedicke, an accounting professor and former Stanford University business school dean who is the chairman of Enron's audit committee. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Whether Enron's audit committee failed as badly as the company did remains to be seen. The Houston energy firm filed for bankruptcy in December after announcing it had overstated financial results for nearly five years. Enron and its accountants are under investigation by Congress, federal prosecutors and the SEC. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:     Washington, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Enron Corp. may have compromised its own investigation of the events leading to the energy trader's bankruptcy by appointing one of its board members to the panel, Democratic lawmakers said.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:     The LJM2 partnership is a target of a dozen government investigations into the collapse of Enron, which filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December. Enron's disclosure in November that Fastow made $30 million managing two off-book partnerships, including LJM2, hastened Enron's collapse.
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:One congressional committee generating heavy interest has not even released a witness list or scheduled its Enron hearing. Yet the permanent subcommittee on investigations is on every Washington reporter's "must attend" list. Why? It has the power to subpoena Enron documents. It is also notorious for tackling juicy topics. This, after all, was the forum used by the late Senator Joseph McCarthy to conduct his anti-communist crusade. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:A senator leading an investigation said Thursday that Enron had not cooperated in providing important information on the complex web of partnerships used by the company to conceal massive debts. The company's attorney said it doesn't have the documents sought. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:  To be sure, Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, will likely remain prominent in the public eye as long as Congress continues its numerous investigations. Turnarounds are always sensitive matters, but it is rare for  the reorganizational efforts to be this public. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:The rest of McCullough's testimony was shunted aside. Outraged Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Ron Wyden, D-Calif., and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., demanded congressional hearings and a federal investigation into this new revelation: Nasty Enron had been manipulating the power market right up until the day it declared bankruptcy. It must have been the culprit behind the western electricity crisis a year ago! 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Enron, of course, has fired its auditor--as if Andersen forced Enron's hand rather than the other way around--and it appears to be clinging to its old religion at least in the early innings of the Enron investigation. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), accused the company yesterday of failing to provide records for thousands of Enron-backed partnerships that were long known to--and approved by-- company directors. Dorgan is chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, one of nine congressional panels probing Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Feb. 1, 2002 | The release of a memo from then-Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney that included recommendations for how to handle the California energy crisis is encouraging the state's top politicians to call for more hearings and investigations into Enron's role. On Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate charges of possible market manipulation by Enron and other power generators in the state. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:"I applaud GAO for standing up for the principles of the right of Congress and the people to know who helped shape the administration's energy policy," said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who helped initiate the GAO investigation last April. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Mr. Davis has been asking FERC to probe possible price manipulation by power suppliers since August 2000. "If there is any doubt in your mind about whether an investigation is warranted, the latest revelations should answer that question," Mr. Davis wrote. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Turning to other news. Enron not cooperating with the United States Senate. That charge coming from Senator Byron Dorgan, one of the lawmakers leading a congressional investigation into Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/11.:Right from the outset, Sullivan, using his daily online column, called for an "investigation" into Krugman's alleged ethical lapse. (By who, the Pundit Police? Is that run out of the Department of Justice?) He suggested Krugman and others "recuse themselves" from the Enron situation, the way Attorney General John Ashcroft did, since as a senator he received Enron contributions. According to Sullivan, the Times columnist should return his Enron money, just as Senator Hillary Clinton had returned the campaign contributions she'd received from Enron. (In Washington, contributions and paychecks are seen as one and the same.) 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/37.:Developments related to the Enron collapse and investigation
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/37.:"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company," Lay said. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron stakeholders." 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/37.:Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive Wednesday, saying the multitude of lawsuits and investigations into Enron's spectacular collapse in an accounting scandal is preventing him from properly running the company. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/37.:WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The following is a chronology of events uncovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation of the financial collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and the role of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.

Wood indicated during the hearing a willingness to open an agency investigation of Enron at the request of West Coast politicians. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/18.:FERC has not officially opened an investigation yet but is expecting a formal request from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington, an agency spokesman said. 
./maildir/martin-t/deleted_items/18.:Any GAO lawsuit would be highly controversial on Capitol Hill. The agency's investigation began after Democrats on April 19 requested that the GAO investigate the conduct, operations and funding of the Cheney energy task force. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky "partnerships." Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:"We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon," House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. "We feel he has a lot to offer." Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:The Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.

Lay, Enron Chairman and CEO. "While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of Andersen's partners working in its Houston office." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:MIAMI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Florida Attorney General's office has subpoenaed documents from Enron Corp. as part of a racketeering investigation into the sale of the energy company's stock to the state pension fund while the share price was plunging, investigators said on Friday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:Republicans say publicly that Racicot's ties to Enron and the company's large campaign donations to Bush and other politicians shouldn't hurt the party in the upcoming elections. Several federal and state investigations are looking into the company's financial collapse. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:AUSTIN, Texas (AP)--Texas' top utility regulator, a former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive whose boss donated money to Gov. Rick Perry after the appointment, has quit amid congressional investigations about the company's financial meltdown. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/96.:Jan. 9, 2002 - The Justice Department opens a criminal investigation of Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:A few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a "leave of absence." But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:The board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:McGurn said, "The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:The lawyers' report concluded that Watkins' concerns did not warrant an in-depth investigation. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Lay is expected to testify Monday before a Senate committee probing Enron, one of at least 10 congressional investigations under way into the collapse of Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Turning to another matter, Mr. Cooper said he expects the results of a special internal investigation, launched as the company slid toward bankruptcy late last year, to be released in coming days. He said senior executives would take "whatever actions are appropriate" in consultation with the creditors' committee to respond to the report's findings. The investigation has been conducted with assistance from William McLucas, former enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and accountants from Deloitte & Touche LLP. Mr. McLucas is now an attorney with the firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering in Washington. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:In addition to the 10 congressional investigations and other government agency probes into Enron, a special committee of Enron's board of directors is expected to issue the results of its own investigation within the next week. Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken against employees if necessary, Cooper said, but he didn't know the full extent of those actions. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Despite the intense scrutiny and investigations that have buffeted Enron, he said, the company still had a solid customer base for its business of providing gas and electricity. That, in turn, gives Enron some crucial cash flow for the revamping process. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Mr. Cooper also said that a report of the results of the internal investigation into the past financial practices that led to Enron's collapse, led by the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, William Powers Jr., would be issued some time in the next three to six days. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Mr. Cooper said that Enron officials would only decide upon disciplinary action once they had reviewed the investigation's findings. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:HOUSTON (AP) - The man tapped to lead Enron Corp. out of the biggest bankruptcy in history said he won't be distracted by the myriad of investigations into the company's collapse.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:ENRON is facing a fresh investigation into allegations it manipulated electricity prices in California at the height of America's power crisis last year.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:The latest development on the allegations of document destruction that hound both Enron and auditors Andersen saw the company admit it was employing a commercial shredding firm until mid-January. It was destroying old payroll and medical records not connected to any congressional or criminal investigations, said Enron. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:But Greenwood lambasted Enron's continued shredding of internal documents until earlier this month, even after the company was aware of numerous government investigations. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:"What they have shredded is their credibility," Greenwood said. "It's outrageous that while Enron was the subject of investigations by the Justice Department, the SEC and multiple committees of Congress, it would get anywhere near a shredder. They shouldn't shred so much as an old newspaper without carefully clearing it with investigators." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:"We have and will continue to comply with requests for information," said spokeswoman Karen Denne. "We asked the Department of Justice to come in and investigate, and the FBI is currently conducting an investigation." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/53.:Stephen Cooper, the bankruptcy consultant selected this week as Enron's interim chief executive, said a special committee of the energy giant's board should complete an internal investigation in less than a week.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/320.:In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/320.:After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/320.:During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/320.:"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations. By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:While the decision to form the task force is final, many details have yet to be worked out, officials said. Some prosecutors involved in the case have not been notified of their specific roles in the task force, and other decisions about where the group will work and how the various strands of investigation will be coordinated have not been determined. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Legal experts who have examined the Enron case said yesterday that by bringing together the disparate pieces of the sprawling criminal investigation of the company, the government is overcoming hurdles that might have hampered the inquiry if it was conducted in separate offices. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:''Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case. ''This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent, and while it doesn't guarantee an indictment, it certainly raises the stakes.'' 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry. For example, in the 1990's, when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section, some critics contended -- to the vehement denials of Justice officials -- that Washington was trying to protect Archer, the politically influential grain company. Enron, whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, has exercised similar political influence in the past. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:The investigation will be run by the department's criminal division coordinating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. "It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations," said Robert Bennett, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. "At the end of day, I'm pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that many of the things said and written [about Enron] aren't true." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday it has launched a criminal investigation into the epic fall of Houston's Enron Corp. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:"This is basically an issue of national scope," said the Justice official, who asked not to be identified. "Because there have been so many questions about this and because there has been so much interest, we are simply acknowledging the investigation." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:"There will be a unification and a structure to the investigation," Bennett said. "We won't have to deal with six or seven different offices." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Since the company's dizzying fall, Enron has been overwhelmed by a blizzard of lawsuits, investigations and subpoenas. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee became the sixth congressional panel to jump into the swirl of Enron investigations. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:"There's an unfortunate rush to judgment here," Bennett said. "Hopefully, people will calm down a little bit and let these investigations proceed." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:The Justice Department's revelation about the criminal investigation task force comes just as Enron is scheduled today to hold an auction for a majority stake in the company's most lucrative operation, its trading business. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy company whose collapse caused many employees to lose their life's savings. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:An attorney for Enron welcomed the inquiry, the latest in a series of governmental probes into the company's demise, saying the investigation would "bring light to the facts."
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:The official declined to say when the investigation began. Enron faces civil investigations by the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and subpoenas from congressional committees. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron's heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron's financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:"It's important for the investigation to proceed to determine what was done and why it was done. The president also believes it's important to explore new policies so it (a similar collapse) can never happen again," Fleischer said. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:No one knows yet the extent of the illegality -- if any -- that went on at Enron. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was launching a criminal investigation. But there is no doubt that many of the company's top officials swam, as a matter of course, in an ethical sewer. They were pals with, and lavishly greased the palms of, powerful people who were willing to guide government policy toward Enron's ends, and who could help the company escape close scrutiny of its more sinister activities. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush violated truth-in-labeling laws during his campaign, when his pledges of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites. But it should. Because we've heard precious little of them since Bush took the oath of office. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:NOW THAT Enron faces a federal investigation in the wake of its largest-ever bankruptcy, it's time for Vice President Dick Cheney to explain fully his closed-door meetings with the fallen energy giant. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:For months, the White House has refused to hand over any information about the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force--a group that was heavy on energy executives, including Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. Both Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the congressional General Accounting Office have insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed. The White House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so. But considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May, from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air Act, Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions. The collapse of Enron Corp., which has led to a federal criminal investigation, just bolsters the argument. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Dealers at electronic brokerage Instinet said shares in Enron fell 17 percent to 65 cents in light volume from a 79 cents close after the U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of Enron, amid controversy over its collapse.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/120.:Robert Bennett, attorney for Enron, said, "When this investigation is finished, a lot of the things that people are reading and hearing will be proven to be not true." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/282.:The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/282.:The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/146.:People close to some of the Congressional investigations expressed concern, however. "Given the array of things that have happened, it's cause for heightened scrutiny," said one. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/146.:Congress is appropriately holding a number of hearings to seek answers to that question. Enron's financial bankruptcy, triggered in part by revelations of faulty financial reporting, was a shocking national calamity. Its post-mortem, which will take the form of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and private lawsuits as well as the Congressional hearings, is likely to reveal serious deficiencies in how the public interest is protected on an array of regulatory fronts. It may lead to new federal regulations of pension plans, accounting procedures and energy markets.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/146.:The Michigan Democrat, chairman of the Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said within weeks, it will subpoena documents from Enron's board, senior managers and auditing firm.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/146.:Enron's ties to the White House aren't helping the former energy giant with any government investigations. Washington watchdog group Public Citizen has just accused it of providing Texas Republican Senator Phil Gramm with more than a quarter-of-a-million dollars in campaign contributions over eight years in exchange for Gramm's support for Enron-backed legislation to eliminate regulations on energy commodity trading. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/146.:The bankrupt former natural gas and electricity trading giant is the subject of investigations by at least five US congressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the departments of Labor and Justice, numerous agencies in multiple US states, and a federal grand jury in Houston. A Senate government committee says it may also look at connections between Enron and the White House. Enron was a major backer of President George W. Bush's election campaign (EC Dec.7,p4).

Powers will be the sole witness Tuesday followed by a half-dozen accounting and corporate governance professors on Wednesday. Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow, who made $30 million from the partnerships, will take the stage on Thursday. Fastow is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right. Also up: former Enron officer Michael Kopper, Richard Causey, Enron's chief accountant, and Richard Buy, Enron's chief risk officer. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:     Hollings also called for a special prosecutor to head the Justice Department investigation of Enron's failure because of financial and business ties between the company and members of President George W. Bush's administration.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:     "There are so many questions, and we wanted to start with the chairman and CEO, Mr. Lay, to ask him what happened, what do you know of what happened, who's accountable and who's responsible,'' Dorgan, who is leading the Senate Commerce Committee investigation into Enron, said at a news conference.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:     Hollings said Enron's ties the administration -- Lay was a longtime contributor to Bush's political campaigns and other administration members had business ties to the company - showed the need for a special prosecutor to head the criminal investigation into Enron's collapse.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       The results of that Enron investigation released over the weekend were damning and served to fuel the Sunday political talk shows. Lawmakers drew the long knives and wasted no time making their feelings known about the report's findings.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       "The company was transferring assets back and forth between partnerships," Fitzgerald said. "At one end the company would book a gain, at the other end there would be initially a loss at the partnership, but then the partnership would transfer it back to Enron, then the partnership would book a gain in a different quarter," Fitzgerald said, paraphrasing the findings of the company's internal investigation. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       He told NBC's Meet the Press that his own committee's investigation tracked what was showing up in Enron's report.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       Houston-based Enron, once the seventh-largest company in America, collapsed in a cloud of debt and questions about its finances and accounting practices. It is under investigation by nine congressional committees, the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:     Lay canceled scheduled testimony today and tomorrow, a move his lawyer blamed on lawmakers' "inflammatory'' comments following the release of an internal company investigation.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:In testimony prepared for delivery to a House Financial Services subcommittee, William Powers, who led an internal investigation into the company's financial crisis, said the probe found "appalling" problems at the Houston energy company. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:A report on the internal investigation was released over the weekend. Powers outlined the main findings in his prepared testimony, focusing on the firm's use of complex, off-the-books partnerships that enriched key employees, including Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:Although highly critical of what it sees as questionable practices by management and its auditors, the report doesn't allege criminal activity. The investigation's scope was limited to studying Enron's related-party transactions. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:A person familiar with the board said the directors could request further, follow-up investigations that might address other outstanding issues. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:In response to the results of the internal probe, Andersen issued a written response Saturday that called the investigation "an attempt to insulate (Enron's) leadership and the board of directors from criticism by shifting blame to others." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:Skilling, along with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, are slated to go before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations on Thursday. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:Also, Ken Lay held "ultimate responsibility for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the officers reporting to him performed their oversight duties properly," according to the internal investigation. "Ultimately, a large measure of the responsibility rests with the (then-)CEO." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:If this happens, more information could come out about the partnerships as well as about allegations of insider trading and mishandling of employees' pension funds by Enron executives - aspects that weren't covered by the internal investigation. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       Meanwhile, in Washington the Senate Commerce Committee said it plans to issue a subpoena to compel former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear before the panel. On Sunday, Lay cancelled this week's scheduled testimony because of what his attorney called an increasingly "prosecutorial" climate. An internal investigation issued over the weekend found Enron collapsed because of massive failures by its management, board and outside advisers. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       Also worrying Wall Street was Global Crossing's announcement that it will appoint a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of accounting-related allegations. The telecom firm filed for bankruptcy protection last week and its accounting methods are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/30.:       Network equipment maker Enterasys Networks, another firm under investigation by the SEC, saw its share price plunge 60 percent as analysts downgraded its stock after the company warned of disappointing quarterly revenues. After Friday's close, Enterasys said it had discovered accounting irregularities in its Asian operations.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       In a statement, Lay said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       The Justice Department said in a statement that it sees no reason to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron. "No person involved in pursuing this investigation has any conflict, or any ties that would require a recusal," the department said.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       Senior Enron executives involved in the partnerships "enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars that they should never have received," William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas Law School, who headed an internal Enron investigation, told a House Financial Services subcommittee Monday.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       Powers was questioned Tuesday by the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee on his findings, as the CEO of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's former accounting firm, was being grilled by a Financial Services subcommittee.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       Powers restated the findings of the internal Enron investigation he headed that found a "systematic and pervasive" attempt by senior Enron managers to "misrepresent the company's financial condition" through the use of partnerships that had no economic value to Enron except to hide debt and artificially inflate profits on Enron's balance sheet.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:       In addition, the Power's investigation "did not speak to people at Andersen," Berardino told the House Financial Services panel. Suggestions that "we did not cooperate with the investigation, nothing could be further from the truth."
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:     An investigation sponsored by Enron's board and released this weekend said Enron executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses from 3,000 partnerships. This morning Arthur Andersen LLP Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino urged Congress to enact tougher penalties for companies that mislead auditors, saying that's what Enron did.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:     Yesterday Hollings called for a special prosecutor to take over the Justice Department's investigation of Enron. Hollings listed a number of Bush administration officials who he said had ties to Enron, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and budget director Mitch Daniels. Hollings said with so many links, a special prosecutor was needed.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:     William Powers Jr., the head of the Enron's internal special investigation, told a congressional panel yesterday that Lay and the rest of the board failed to halt ``a systematic and pervasive attempt'' by management to deceive investors about the energy dealer's finances.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/22.:     The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well as Congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankruptcy in corporate history in December.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:Marks said that when Enron officials found the shredded documents, he immediately called Leslie Ragon Caldwell, head of the federal task force conducting a criminal investigation of Enron. Caldwell told him, he said, that the FBI would begin interviewing Enron employees to determine what was shredded, when and why. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:The Enron attorney said the documents may have been unrelated to the company's collapse, and there may be "a completely innocent explanation" for the shredding. "There will be an extensive investigation coordinated under the auspices of the Justice Department," he said. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:William Lerach, an attorney for one group suing Enron officials and Andersen, brought a box overflowing with shredded paper to a hearing before U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon. Visible on the shredded documents were references to two partnerships, Jedi II and Raptor, that are at the center of the widening investigations of Enron's collapse. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:New York University law professor Stephen Gillers says a lawyer's first advice to someone facing investigation ought to be "freeze." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:Bush made a preemptive strike against the upcoming Capitol Hill investigations of Enron, several of which are likely to explore his administration's treatment of major donors, including Enron executives. "The Congress also needs to stay focused on the American people," Bush said. "We're running a war. We've got to make sure our homeland is secure, and we've got to make sure people can find work. And we'll take care of our business." 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:Bush pointed to an investigation of the handling of Enron employees' pension funds that was begun by the Labor Department "before anybody started paying attention to Enron." The investigation was announced three days after Enron's bankruptcy filing. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/82.:Enron, which is under investigation in the U.S. for allegedly trying to conceal massive losses, wants to sell its unit in India due to disputes with its sole buyer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and with the federal government over payment guarantees. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/114.:Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company's looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he's received from company executives. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/114.:Ashcroft stepped aside from the criminal investigation of Enron because he received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000. In addition to contributing to Ashcroft's senatorial campaign, Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Enron, Lay and other executives have also been major contributors to President George Bush, both during his 2000 presidential campaign and during his runs for the Texas statehouse. Prior to Lay's contacts with O'Neill and Evans, Enron officials had extensive contact with Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides, when they worked together on a response to a much ballyhooed but quickly deflated energy crisis <http://forbes.com/2001/05/02/0502nocrisis.html> in the spring of 2001. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/114.:Trying to insulate himself from the scandal, President Bush has ordered a review headed by O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules. That review is intended, the administration says, to avoid a repeat of the energy-trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost most or all of their life savings. But Fleischer dismissed suggestions that the Justice Department investigation announced earlier this week should give way to a probe by an independent counsel.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The federal government is expanding its criminal and civil investigations into the collapse of Enron Corp. by looking into the shredding of documents at the energy trader.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:Former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda said that she saw staffers in Enron's accounting and finance departments review and shred thousands of documents. She said it started when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a formal investigation. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest Chapter 11 filing in the history of the United States.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:       The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron's accounting practices in mid-October, after the company reported more than $600 million in third-quarter losses, and a congressional committee began asking for documents in mid-December. The SEC opened a formal investigation at the end of October, including demands for financial documents from Enron and Andersen.
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:       The Justice Department announced on Jan. 9 that it was pursuing a criminal investigation of Enron, which entered the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 following a six-week downward spiral.

./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - As Congress pursues a raft of investigations into the collapse of Enron Corp., some experts warn that lawmakers' zeal could trip up the Justice Department's criminal probe. 
./maildir/martin-t/inbox/88.:Instead, the company brought in Vinson & Elkins. After an inquiry, the law firm reported on Oct. 15 that the practices caused concern "because of the bad cosmetics" and could result in adverse publicity and litigation, but warranted no "further widespread investigation by independent counsel and auditors."

./maildir/shankman-j/deleted_items/38.:The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.

Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million.

./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.

But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening.

Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/beck-s/inbox/717.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures.

Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

This is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes.  If Reliant loses their case, it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy.  What's more, financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience, and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy.  PG&E in particular simply will not agree to Davis' transmission lines deal as it stands, and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best, albeit uncertain, chance of a return to eventual health someday.

Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/42.:Enron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/42.:The remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/42.:FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Enron delivered another bombshell on a day when Wall Street was anticipating a merger announcement. The tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation. Enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $600 million. The company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet. Enron would pump assets into a partnership, then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books. Consolidating the partnerships also boosted Enron`s debt by more than $2.5 billion. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/42.:The SEC has launched a formal investigation in the Enron matter. The Arthur Andersen spokesman said the SEC had not notified his firm that it is the subject of any investigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/24.:Enron shares traded Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange at $6.99, down $2.07, or 22.9 percent, on volume topping 53 million shares. They have fallen more than 91 percent in 2001 amid accounting problems, earnings restatements, a federal investigation and management changes.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/24.:Wall Street analysts, however, said the announcement was not surprising following the company's recent credit downgrades and Enron's board investigation into the company's balance sheet.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/41.:But Enron can't issue new stock now because it's under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, so it would be obliged to come up with the $40-per-share difference in cash. Since Enron owns 50% of Whitewing, it could tear up most of the convertibles, but not all of them. A rough estimate is that Enron - or Dynegy - would still owe the dozens of mutual funds that invested in Whitewing around $500 million cash. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/41.:One Wall Street equity derivatives trading manager indicated that all the banks have found themselves "unexpectedly short in-the-money puts" on Enron. Unexpectedly, perhaps, not just because Enron stock has fallen so far, but because the SEC investigation prevents Enron from issuing additional shares. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/41.:Wall Street has been sweating for weeks, and millions don't make Wall Street sweat. Billions do, and the concern has to do with liabilities beyond Enron's fully disclosed traditional debt. The banks have told Enron they don't expect to get clobbered on a technicality that wouldn't have arisen without the SEC investigation Enron brought on itself, a person at a bank involved in the talks said. Enron agreed in principle, but the negotiations to make Wall Street whole were put on hold for the Dynegy talks.

Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/31.:With its stock falling to new lows and its credit rating battered, energy giant Enron is desperately searching for new capital. Sources close to the Houston company say it's considering deals with other energy-trading companies, private-equity firms, and blue-chip saviors such as GE Capital. The Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported that Dynegy is in merger talks with Enron. The company's financial crisis was sparked by disclosures about some of its off-balance-sheet partnership deals negotiated by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. A Securities & Exchange Commission investigation and the threat of liabilities from shareholder lawsuits could make it tough for Enron to land a new investor.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/32.:Once a Wall Street high-flyer boasting a $90 share price just 15 months ago, Enron fell from grace after off-balance sheet transactions and financial reporting lapses prompted a regulatory investigation and senior official resignations.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/38.:Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an "unfortunate situation" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/38.:Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements also is a major embarrassment for the directors who sit on the Enron board's audit committee, which serves as the overseer of Enron's financial reporting, internal controls and compliance processes. Among the committee members is Wendy Gramm, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the wife of U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas). Ms. Gramm also was a member of the audit committee of IBP Inc., a meatpacking company that earlier this year became engulfed in an accounting debacle that prompted an SEC investigation and nearly derailed Tyson Foods' since-completed plan to buy the company. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/38.:Enron's partnership dealings have sparked more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits and a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a measure of the continuing concerns over Enron's financial condition, both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's once again downgraded Enron's debt on Friday, this time to just one level above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. They also kept the company under review for possible additional downgrades and S&P put Dynegy on the same status. A downgrade to junk status could force Enron to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash or stock to buttress some of its complicated financial transactions. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/38.:Enron's stock price has fallen about 80% in the past three weeks, and its credit rating has been downgraded to one level above noninvestment grade, due to uncertainties about the transparency of its complex financial structure.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/38.:The buyout, announced on Friday, calls for Dynegy to swap 0.2685 share for each Enron share, valuing Enron at $10.41 a share.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:DALLAS, Nov. 1 -- With investors absorbing news of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit-rating agency, shares of the Enron Corporation fell 13.7 percent today, giving back most of the gains from Wednesday's rally. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:Late on Wednesday, Enron, the energy-trading giant based in Houston, said the S.E.C. had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:Enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the S.E.C. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. Enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:With an ongoing investigation by US securities regulators into Enron's accounting and disclosure practices, and Enron's market value falling by half in the past two weeks, many are wondering what impact Enron's mounting troubles could have on the trading markets. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:Those deals raised questions about whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of Enron's other shareholders, which became the basis for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:However, woes continued for Enron, the embattled energy trading company, which fell 9.4 per cent at Dollars 12.59 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission upgraded its probe into the company's accounting methods to a formal investigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:Shares in the Houston-based company, whose dealings are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tumbled $1.91, or 13.7 percent, to $11.99 as the market continued a two-week-long pummeling of the stock.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:The company said on Wednesday an SEC "informal inquiry" begun Oct. 22 had become a formal investigation, possibly indicating regulators did not like what they had seen. It elected University of Texas law school dean William Powers to the board of directors and put him in charge of an internal probe into the deals. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:But after the markets closed Wednesday, Enron announced the Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into possible conflicts of interest. The SEC is apparently looking into dealings Enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was forced out last week. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/55.:Late Wednesday, Enron said it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors.

Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures. That was the lowest price for the stock since 1991. It rebounded to nearly $10 after Dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into the transactions, which sent Enron's stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/16.:Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the past few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a process that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/16.:Just this month, in three separate lawsuits -- the latest filed yesterday -- participants in Enron's 401(k) plan allege that Enron misled them about the risks of investing in the company's shares. The suits, all filed in Federal District Court in Houston, note that the company "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes. That prevented all employees, regardless of age, from selling any Enron shares in their 401(k)s as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. Enron says it doesn't comment on pending litigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/16.:In October, Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to buy back 55 million shares it had issued to the partnerships. The charge associated with "unwinding" the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen $618 million third-quarter loss. It also spurred a markdown of Enron's credit ratings to just above junk-bond status, as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's partnership practices. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/16.:Enron already is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over controversial deals involving limited partnerships organized and run by former company executives.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"It's a huge cloud of uncertainty," said Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fleishman, who wouldn't speculate about the breadth of the investigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Enron said late Wednesday that the SEC has elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into "certain of the matters that were the subject of recent press reports." The SEC, as a matter of policy, declined to comment on the status or scope of any inquiry. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said it was her understanding that the formal investigation, like the informal inquiry, would be limited to the partnerships. Enron is fully cooperating with the SEC, she said. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Investors are already pricing in the possibility the SEC investigation will reveal more bad news, Christensen said. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"This is a serious situation, especially since the investigation moved from Forth Worth to Washington D.C.," Hoves said. "It's hard to say, but my guess is this will be an open-book investigation and they will go into a whole lot of stuff beyond the partnership."
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"Ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside, we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on Enron until the investigation concludes," said Donato Eassey of Merrill Lynch, who lowered his rating on Enron's stock to "neutral" from "accumulate" earlier on Thursday. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Shares of Enron continued their freefall, despite the company's announcement of new credit lines, after the Securities and Exchange Commission said late Wednesday it would make an informal inquiry into the company a full-scale investigation.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell for the 11th time in 12 sessions Thursday after the energy merchant said the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a formal investigation into two of its limited partnerships.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"As you know, the commission conducts its investigations on a non-public basis and thus we cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation that may or may not be taking place," said Michael Robinson, an SEC spokesperson. "Applicable government-wide ethics rules required that Mr. Cutler recuse himself from all matters involving Wilmer, Cutler for one year following his departure from the firm, and he did so."
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"As a formal investigation, the SEC must now use its subpoena power to compel the production of documents and witnesses. The assembly of a high-powered legal team is further evidence this company is digging in for a fight," he said.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Initially, the SEC decided to pursue an informal inquiry into related-party transactions involving the company. Now, the SEC is making this a formal investigation. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:As such, the agency would investigate whether the company disclosed all that was required with regard to the related-party transactions, Meyers said, adding that the most important factor in the case's transition to a formal investigation is that the SEC can exercise subpoena power.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey downgraded Enron Thursday to "neutral" from "accumulate/buy," citing the uncertainty about the outcome of the SEC investigation.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/56.:"We believe the timing and directional uncertainty of this new development will at best cap Enron's stock price in the mid-teen's while increasing overall volatility," Eassey wrote in a note to clients. The investigation will way on the stock until it concludes. "Timing is uncertain, but could feasibly take months."

Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans.

Earlier in the month, Enron fired chief financial officer Andy Fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the SEC.  Enron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001. Enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the SEC launched a probe of some transactions by company executives. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening.

Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.

./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/25.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.

In recent weeks, Enron's labyrinth of financial transactions, particularly with members of company management, has come under intense scrutiny from investors and regulators, who are seeking information about the impact of the transactions on the company and whether Enron adequately disclosed the deals to the public. Enron last week disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun a formal investigation.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:One thing is certain: The stakes for Andersen could be high. Since Enron's disclosure of the reduction in shareholder equity, its stock has plunged 67% to $11.30 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday -- a drop that wipes $20 billion off the company's market value and potentially exposing Enron and Andersen to massive shareholder liability. Already, Enron's dealings with the partnerships are the subject of a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That creates the possibility that Andersen itself could become a focus of the probe at some point, should regulators find Enron's accounting and disclosure practices deficient. Meanwhile, the law firm for a special committee set up by Enron's board has hired accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP to help review the partnerships' activities. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:An Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, says the firm "will continue to cooperate with [Enron's] special committee, lawyers and accounting advisers" and "will also cooperate with other official investigations as requested." So far, he says, the SEC hasn't told Andersen it is a subject of the Enron probe. Beyond that, he declines to comment on Enron, citing client-confidentiality obligations. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:They said the mandate of the Special Committee, created by Enron's board to examine the transactions in question and liaise with the Securities and Exchange Commission during its investigation, was too narrow. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:It said that Kopper was an associate of Andrew Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer who has been linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. 
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:That payment appears to have been the last step in a complex series of transactions that allowed Enron to keep hundreds of millions of dollars of debt off its balance sheet for the past three years, during which the Houston-based energy-trading giant has grown rapidly. In recent weeks, Enron's labyrinth of financial transactions, particularly with members of company management, has come under intense scrutiny from investors and regulators, who are seeking information about the impact of the transactions on the company and whether Enron adequately disclosed the deals to the public. Enron last week disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun a formal investigation.
./maildir/kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/52.:While Houston-based Enron lined up US$1-billion of new credit last Thursday, it still suffered a second credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial transactions that have triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

./maildir/blair-l/deleted_items/612.:Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the past few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a process that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress. 
./maildir/blair-l/deleted_items/612.:Just this month, in three separate lawsuits -- the latest filed yesterday -- participants in Enron's 401(k) plan allege that Enron misled them about the risks of investing in the company's shares. The suits, all filed in Federal District Court in Houston, note that the company "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes. That prevented all employees, regardless of age, from selling any Enron shares in their 401(k)s as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. Enron says it doesn't comment on pending litigation. 
./maildir/blair-l/deleted_items/612.:In October, Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to buy back 55 million shares it had issued to the partnerships. The charge associated with "unwinding" the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen $618 million third-quarter loss. It also spurred a markdown of Enron's credit ratings to just above junk-bond status, as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's partnership practices. 
./maildir/blair-l/deleted_items/612.:Enron already is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over controversial deals involving limited partnerships organized and run by former company executives.
./maildir/blair-l/inbox/232.:Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow.

Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.

./maildir/whalley-g/deleted_items/30.:In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
./maildir/whalley-g/deleted_items/30.:After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
./maildir/whalley-g/deleted_items/30.:During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships.

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/134.:Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation.

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.

./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/whalley-g/inbox/421.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.

./maildir/motley-m/inbox/72.:An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms.

Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law.

./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors.

./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/shapiro-r/deleted_items/897.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.

Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

The ICC states that it is concerned that levelized rates "...would negatively impact retail competition in Illinois due to the fact that the transmission component of bundled retail rates in Illinois was determinined on a net plant basis.  With bundled retail rates effectively frozen in Illinois though the end of 2004,  any increase in the unbundled transmission rate will serve as a disincentive for retail customers to switch to unbundled service."  ICC concludes that this would take the competitive pressure off of Com Ed and goes on to mention that intervenors have raised similar issues in the DST case before the ICC.

./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/278.:According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements.

./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/97.:In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/97.:After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/97.:During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
./maildir/mckay-b/deleted_items/97.:"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey.

The evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the YAHOO Message Board by an unnamed power trader in Spokane (we think it is an Avista trader), selected transmission data from the ISO, the LA Times article of April 11, 2001 regarding the ISO's report on Powerex, BPA and LADWP, the ISO report itself, and BC Hydro's residential rate schedule.  CARE requests FERC to initiate an investigation, seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want FERC to have the Secretary of DOE declare an emergency under Section 202(c) of the FPA and compel deliveries of electricity.

./maildir/williams-w3/sent_items/41.:The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense.

./maildir/williams-w3/bill_williams_iii/295.:The controversy involves nearly a dozen Davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in California. Their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statements--revelations that resulted, in part, from Jones' pressure. Five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations.

./maildir/williams-w3/bill_williams_iii/476.:One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants.

./maildir/ermis-f/inbox/543.:The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a "more complete investigation" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is "an abuse of process," the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. 
./maildir/ermis-f/inbox/543.:In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
./maildir/ermis-f/inbox/543.:The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel "seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head," the companies said. 
./maildir/ermis-f/inbox/543.:MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed "potential violations" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be "other potential explanations" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. "We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001." MOE conceded its motion was an "unusual" move.

Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
./maildir/kean-s/deleted_items/410.:In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.

./maildir/lay-k/inbox/562.:Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

If you receive a letter of investigation or other inquiry from the FAA, you should contact one of our aviation technical specialists (800/USA-AOPA) immediately to learn more about the enforcement process. Members who are enrolled in the AOPA Legal Services Plan will have access to legal advice to address their concerns. Click here <http://www.aopa.org/info/certified/lsp.html> for more on the plan. For more on the FAA's enforcement procedure and your options, see AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/members/files/guides/enforce.html>.
./maildir/holst-k/deleted_items/237.:This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  
./maildir/holst-k/inbox/253.:The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a "more complete investigation" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is "an abuse of process," the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. 
./maildir/holst-k/inbox/253.:In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
./maildir/holst-k/inbox/253.:The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel "seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head," the companies said. 
./maildir/holst-k/inbox/253.:MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed "potential violations" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be "other potential explanations" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. "We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001." MOE conceded its motion was an "unusual" move.
